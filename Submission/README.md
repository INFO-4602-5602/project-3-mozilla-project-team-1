**Brief description of our project(What):**
<br></br>
This project explores Mozilla survey dataset, which explored people's perceptions towards a highly connected world. All of our four visualizations focus on discovering how people's technical level or geolocation (e.g., country) influence those perceptions about technology.

**Our design process(How and Why):**
* Why:
     <br>1)We first discussed and settled down the theme of our project, which is how different factors related to the tech level or geolocation, e.g., privacy concerns, criteria for purchasing tech products, who to protect safety, security and privacy online and attitude towards a connected future.</br>
     <br>2)With this theme, we brainstromed possible questions that can be explored and listed them in a worksheet. We analyzed them in terms of ways to visualize, meaningfulness, necessities and so on. Based on our analysis, we chose four questions to explore and visualize: 1) What the geo distribution of people with different technical level?, 2) What is the relationship between tech level/geo information and perceptions of privacy? 3) What is the relationship between geo information and criteria when purchasing tech products? 4) What is the relationship between tech level and who to provide protection online, attitude towards a connected future?</br>
