<br></br>Team member:  Keke Wu, Wei Miao, Xu Han, Yawen Zhang, Jiawen Liu


**Brief description of our project(What):**
<br></br>
This project explores the National Center for Women in Technology(NCWIT) dataset. All of our four visualizations focus on comparisons between female and male from different aspects: time, enrollment number, graduated number, drop-out(left institution) number, major declaration time and race distribution.
<br></br>

**Brief description of Visualization 1:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: The Ratio of Female to Male in Enrollment, Graduated and Dropout Count with Years
* Interactions part:
     * Checkbox showing ratio in Enrollment and/or Graduated and/or Dropout count;
     * Mouseover showing hoverline over different years with Ratio values
* Conclusions:
     * The ratio of female/male in Enrollment and Graduated are higher than Dropout, indicating less female per male dropout during school years.
     * The enrollment ratio gradually incresed indicates that more and more female enrolled in CS-related major.


**Brief description of Visualization 2:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: The Actual Count in Enrollment, Graduated and Dropout of Female and Male with Years
* Interactions part:
     * Mouseover to get detailed data information.
     * Click on legends to filter data.
* Conclusions: The number of male is much more than female in all enrollment, graduated and dropout aspects.

<br></br>

**Brief description of Visualization 3:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: The Enrollment Count with Major Declaration Time of Female and Male
* Interactions part:  
     * Checkbox showing Male and Female charts;
     * Mouseover getting tooltips of amount and percentage;
     * Legend filtering data
* Conclusions:
     * Enrollment trend is almost the same between male and female students.
     * Enrollment count decreases as time goes by.

**Brief description of Visualization 4:**
<br></br>
* What does it show: It shows the race distribution among total students with gender and year.
* Interactions part: In this visualization, the data has three layers, the first layer is gender, the second layer is year with each gender and the third layer is race distribution with each year and gender. In this case, this pie chart can be zoomed in/out to layer.
     * Click on the pie chart to zoom in;
     * Click in the center to zoom out;
     * Mouseover getting tooltips of label and percentage;

* Conclusions:
     * Number of male students are much more than female students no matter which year
     * Number of students increased sharply after 2010 no matter which gender
     * White, asian and hispanics are top dominated races no matter which year which gender

**Our design process(How and Why):**
* Why:
     <br>1)We first discussed and settled down the theme of our project, which is how different factors related to the technical level of individual, e.g., geolocation, privacy concerns, owning tech products, who to protect safety, security and privacy online and attitude towards a connected future.</br>
     <br>2)With this theme, we brainstromed possible questions that can be explored and listed them in a worksheet. We analyzed them in terms of ways to visualize, meaningfulness, necessities and so on. Based on our analysis, we chose four questions to explore and visualize: 1) What the geo distribution of people with different technical level?, 2)  </br>
