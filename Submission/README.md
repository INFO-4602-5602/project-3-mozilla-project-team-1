**Brief description of our project(What):**
<br></br>
This project explores Mozilla survey dataset, which collected people's perceptions towards a highly connected world. All of our four visualizations focus on discovering how people's technical level or geolocation (e.g., country) influence their perceptions about technology.
<br></br>

**Brief description of Visualization 1:**
<br></br>
* What does it show:
     * Global distribution and comparison of people’s tech proficient in four levels.
* Interactions part:
     * Switching among different tech level data from the dropdown list.
     * Mouse over to show a tooltip of the proportion of current tech level of the selected country.
     * Mouse over to show the detail count and proportion of the current tech level in a donut chart.
* Conclusions:
     * Tech ratio of tech level in "Ultra Nerd" and "Luddite" is very low in all countries, most of the people are tech-savvy.
     * The number of people involved in the survey varies widely，in some countries only less than 10 people took the survey, while the countries like USA has about 20,000 people involved in the survey. So it may not reflecting the real situation when the number of participants in the survey was very small.
     * There is no clear standard for technical levels, so people from different countries may have different criteria to evaluate themselves.

**Brief description of Visualization 4:**
<br></br>
* What does it show:
     * The relationships between different tech levels and people's perceptions: 1) Who should protect your safety, security and privacy online? 2) How do you think about a world highly connected to internet?
* Interactions part:
     * Mouse over text/bar to show detailed distribution of each category, with updated percentages.
     * Coordinate views between two subgraphs, showing detailed informations corresponding to the same tech level.
* Conclusions:
     * Most people with higher tech level (Technically Savvy or Ultra Nerd) think non-profit organizations like Mozilla should protect their safety, security and privacy online, while most people with lower tech level (Average User or Luddite) don't know who to trust.
     * Most people with higher tech level (Technically Savvy or Ultra Nerd) are cautiously optimistic about a highly connected future, while most people with lower tech level (Average User or Luddite) are a little wary about a highly connected future.
     * Interestingly, people with highest tech level (Ultra Nerd) and people with lowest tech level (Luddite) have higher percentage of people who are scared as hell about a highly connected future than the other groups.

**Our design process(How and Why):**
* Why:
     <br>1)We first discussed and settled down the theme of our project, which is how different factors related to the tech level or geolocation, e.g., privacy concerns, criteria for purchasing tech products, who to protect safety, security and privacy online and attitude towards a connected future.</br>
     <br>2)With this theme, we brainstromed possible questions that can be explored and listed them in a worksheet. We analyzed them in terms of ways to visualize, meaningfulness, necessities and so on. Based on our analysis, we chose four questions to explore and visualize: 1) What the geo distribution of people with different technical level?, 2) What is the relationship between tech level/geo information and perceptions of privacy? 3) What is the relationship between geo information and criteria when purchasing tech products? 4) What is the relationship between tech level and who to provide protection online, attitude towards a connected future?</br>
